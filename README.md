# Parking_Spot_Detector_And_Classifier

Parking management is a significant challenge for large
institutions, where a limited number of parking spaces must
accommodate a high volume of vehicles. To address this issue,
an intelligent parking management system that efficiently
monitors and updates parking availability in real-time needs
to be implemented.
The proposed solution makes use of classical image pro-
cessing techniques to detect and classify parking spaces as
either occupied or vacant. This system aims to provide a
cost-effective and scalable alternative to traditional manual
monitoring, which is labour-intensive, error-prone, and unable
to deliver real-time updates.
